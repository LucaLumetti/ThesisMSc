\section{IAC datasets}
One of the most common issue that must be faced when using a deep learning,
especially in the medical imagin field, is to have a quality dataset. Inferior
Alveolar Canal detection has been the focus of multiple recent works but the
small size of 3D maxillofacial datasets strongly limited the performance of
these algorithms. Researchers build their own private datasets thus limiting the
ability to reproduce published results. The reason of this lack is due to the
huge time effort required to annotated this type of images, that must be carried
out by medical experts.

\subsection{Maxillo}
Maxillo is a novel, large, and publicly available maxillo-facial CBCT dataset,
with 2D and 3D manual annotations, provided by expert clinicians, published by
Cipriano et. al in 2022.
